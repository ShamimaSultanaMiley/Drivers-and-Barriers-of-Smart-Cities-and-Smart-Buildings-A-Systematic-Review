# Drivers-and-Barriers-of-Smart-Cities-and-Smart-Buildings-A-Systematic-Review
Smart cities and smart buildings use technological advancements and Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and sensors to create a sustainable environment. This study aims to identify and characterize the drivers and barriers of smart city and smart building implementations and the factors that influence and hinder its implementation. In this study, 49 drivers and 48 barriers have been perceived and characterized. The perceived drivers and barriers were further labeled into different categories using the document study method. The 49 drivers were categorized into 10 categories while the 48 barriers were categorized into 8 categories. The drivers and barriers were assigned into strength, weakness,opportunity and threats according to the internal and external factors and roles the categories play. In addition, the study also identifies the role smart cities and smart buildings play in sustainability in creating an eco-friendly environment, enabling sustainable practices and in energy, water and waste management through the use of technological innovations.
